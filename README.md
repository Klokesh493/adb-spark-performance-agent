# Adb Spark Performance Agent

Find a skewed Spark task from stage timing summaries.

## Quick start

Run `python3 agent.py example.json` with Python 3.10 or newer. Compare the result with `expected.json`. The JSON keys in the example define the supported input shape.

This offline prototype reads synthetic input and returns a recommendation or diagnostic. It uses no credentials, external APIs, or infrastructure mutations. Results require operator review.
